    <h5>“Butterflies are nature’s angels…They remind us what a gift it is to be alive”- Robyn Nola.

        Butterflies are one of the most beautiful creatures in our world. They are colourful insects with scaly wings. We can find them in our gardens, parks, and forests. Butterflies belong to the same order Lepidoptera as that of the moths. Lepidos have Greek origin and mean scales, whereas; ptera represents the wings. Research estimates specify that about 28,000 butterfly species exist in this world.</h5>
